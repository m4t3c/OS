Yesterday, somebody whacked out my mural
That energy'll make you niggas move to Europe
But it's regular for me, yeah, that's for sure
The love and hate is definite without a cure
All this talk is bitch-made, that's on my Lord
I'll kill 'em all before I let 'em kill my joy
I done been through it all, what you endure?
It used to be fuck that nigga, but now it's plural
